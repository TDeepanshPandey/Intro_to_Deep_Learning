# Introduction to Deep Learning (Honor's Code)
These are my projects that I have completed to get at Honors Certificate in Introduction to Deep Learning Course offered by National Research University. The library used is Keras and Tensorflow. During the course, I have worked on various difficulty levels of project on different dataset. List of projects - 

1. Linear Model and Optimization
2. MNIST data classification using TF
3. Neural Network Using NUMPY
4. CNN on CIFAR-10
5. Fine Tuning on flower dataset
6. Autoencoders
7. GANs
8. Generating Names with RNN

**Final Project - Image Caption Generation**
